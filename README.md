|---|---|
| Purchase History | Log products after each simulated checkout |
| Search History | Store user search queries |
| Product Browsing Time | Track time spent on individual product/category pages |

---

### ü§ñ AI Recommendation Logic (For Demo):

A lightweight, rule-based recommendation system using heuristics:

| User Action | Recommendation Weight |
|---|---|
| Viewed Product (for > X seconds) | +2 |
| Searched for product keywords | +3 |
| Added to Cart | +4 |
| Purchased | +5 |

#### Recommendation Flow:
- Calculate a score for each product based on user history.
- Display top 3-5 highest scoring products in a **‚ÄúRecommended for You‚Äù** section on:
  - Homepage
  - Cart page (before checkout)
  - User profile page (optional)

**Note:** This is a mock AI simulation for hackathon. Real ML models can replace this logic post-hackathon.
